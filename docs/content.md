## Agenda

* CQRS - Why? When? How?
  * Sometimes there are choices
  * Sometimes the decision is natural
  * Consequences
* Event Sourcing
  * Again: Why? When? How?
* Eventual consistency

---

## Data access, "traditionally"

```cs
ImportantData editObject;

protected override void OnInit(EventArgs e) {
  editObject = LoadEditObject();
  control.DataSource = editObject;
  control.DataBind();
}

protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) {
  if (IsPostBack) {
    MergeEditorChanges(editObject);
    SaveObject(editObject);
  } ...
}
```

^

## Data access, "traditionally"

* Objects are loaded into memory
* Data is shown in UI
* Changes are submitted
* Loaded objects are modified
* Local change detection optimizes process of persistence

^

## CQRS --- Why?

* Because "loading data for visualization" doesn't have the same requirements as "persisting data"
* Because one loading process can be different from another
* Because one persistence process can be different from another
* Because we can save time in "page cycle" environments
* Because separate execution paths are easier to test and maintain

^

## CQRS --- When?

* Almost anytime!
* Typical doubts:
  * Pure client app --- do I benefit?
  * More complex structure == more complicated maintenance work?
  * But what about ORM?

^

## CQRS --- How?

* Separate execution paths for data reading and writing
* Consider modeling changes as commands
* Consider efficient data models to support business operations

## Event Sourcing

* Starting from *command* idea
  * Primarily persist events, instead of data
  * Append-only event log
  * Derive entity state at any time, for any point in time
* Entities/Aggregates/domain objects
* Optimizations: snapshots, projections, (persistent) read models

^

## Event Sourcing --- Why?

* Events describe what the system was asked to do, any technical consequences of an event are not set in stone. Fantastic for long-term maintenance!
* Clean, extensible and scalable structure, supporting strict separations of concerns.
* Event Storming --- very practical planning method

^

## Event Sourcing --- When?

* Tempting pattern for many applications, but with structural consequences
  * In-process? Possible...

^

## Event Sourcing --- How? 

* Any service can receive commands
* Raising domain events across service boundaries requires communication infrastructure
* Persisting events and possibly read models requires a persistence layer
* Structural maintenance of aggregates and projections is a bit fiddly
* Recommended: use libraries existing for all platforms

## Eventual consistency

> Consistency is over-rated (Greg Young, Mr CQRS)

* General issue in distributed systems - CAP theorem
* Eventual consistency exists in the real world. Starbucks?
* How eventual are things in your system?
* Business logic needs to deal with issues resulting from eventual consistency
  * Compensation
  * Special programming tactics
